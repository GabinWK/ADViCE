About page

The broader ambition of the centre of excellence is to coordinate and engage with AI and decarbonisation stakeholders across high-emitting sectors. This initiative is designed to foster cross-sector collaboration, define key challenges that are tractable to AI solutions, and disseminate information to relevant stakeholders. By facilitating the dissemination of knowledge, ADVICE aims to coordinate AI innovations efforts directed at decarbonisation applications. 

The virtual centre of excellence will act as the front door for the community (collaborators, participants and contributors) to foster a vital ecosystem which will:

- Disseminate information publicly and to relevant networks
- Identify strategic and priority challenges for AI innovation for decarbonisation
- Provide pathways to leverage private funding
